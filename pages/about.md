### About

VPS is a database for virtual pinball files. Files are sorted by game and can be of different types, supporting different features, and having multiple download locations.

&nbsp;


> Please keep in mind that we're still in beta! More features are coming, the database is beeing updated and bugs are being fixed every day :)

&nbsp;


##### Lists
Each list usually has multiple displays, either as cards, in a simple table, or the PincabPreview. The 3D pincab preview is more of a nice gimmick for you to enjoy, beware of the game table preview though as it can be heavy on your PC!

##### New tables
Shows the newest tables added to VPS.

##### Search
The database is indexed for extensive full-text search! Use the search bar to search for a table name, manufacturer, author, designer or theme!

##### Filters
On the left side, you see some filters. Use them to filter the shown tables. They can be used together with the search or by themselves. The checkbox on the filters toggles them on or off.

##### Light / Dark Mode
VPS defaults to dark mode although you can switch to light on the top right corner of the page

##### Administration
